## Overview

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it.

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Bootstrap

### What I learned

I learn't about how the marker pseudo-element can be used to target and style the numbers and bullet points
in the ordered and unordered lists.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```css
ol li::marker {
  color: hsl(14, 45%, 36%); /* The marker is the number */
  font-weight: 600;
}

ul li::marker {
  color: hsl(14, 45%, 36%); /* The marker is the bullet points */
  font-weight: 600;
}
```

### Continued development

I plan to use React.js to create the different components of this recipe page soon. I will also try using React Bootstrap
to style the elements attractively.

### Useful resources

- [Resource 1](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/::marker) - This helped me to learn about the ::marker CSS pseudo-element.
